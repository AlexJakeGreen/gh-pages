If Xcode says 'Expected expression'

![Expected expression](/assets/images/xcode-expected-expression.png)

and you have no clue what is causing this message,

try to check invisible symbols `Editor -> Show Invisibles`:

![Show Invisibles](/assets/images/xcode-editor-show-hidden-characters.png)

`^S` is a `Ctrl-x-s` sequence quite often used in Emacs.
